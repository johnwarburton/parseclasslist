parseclasslist
==============

This script will work on 90% of all lines, but some exceptions have to be cleaned up manually:
* Fields that wrap that cause the line to wrap
* Mobile phone numbers that do not start with a + or digit. Usually open parentheses
* Student names that are not 2 words
* Missing addresses have to be filled with NA
